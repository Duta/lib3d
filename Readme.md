#lib3d Documentation

##Info

This is a library entirely written by me.

Because of that, and the sheer number of better libraries out there, I say this:

**I don't encourage use of this library.**

I know that's a weird thing for its creator to say, but it's true (for now, at least). Use a well-established library (there are many).

This library is mainly a self-teaching exercise. If you want to look over the code, be my guest! I'm also open to pull requests, if you have any.

##Notes

 - Uses row vectors (not column ones).
 - Uses a left-handed co-ordinate system.
 - Positive rotations cause a counter-clockwise rotation.
